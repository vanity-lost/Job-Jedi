 
With the background information {background}, now you are given the latex template {template}. Using the background information and keeping the latex structure as unchanged, modify the text part of the latex template to generate a one-page resume that includes ONLY the heading, education and experience sections. Pay attention to deliberately exclude any unnecessary pieces of information in the generated resume: DO NOT include any projects and/or skills. Remember that in latex, we put the backslash '\' before the special characters, such as '#'. Use only utf-8 characters for the generated resume.
